ABOUT
=====

gst-viewperf is an utility to visually see what's happening in the pipeline. To do this, simply put queues anywhere you need to see.

There are currently three health indicators:
* queue filling states, by polling queue properties; queue maximum filling is volontarily raised so that you can see the changes easily
* plugin-related relative elapsed time, using progressreport
* videorate drops and duplicates, which indicates how stable the source is

INSTALLING
==========
Depending on your installed version of clutter/touchwizard, execute the right install script
