gst-viewperf is an utility to visually see what's happening in the pipeline. To do this, simply put queues anywhere you need to see.

There are currently two health indicators:
* queue filling states, by polling queue properties; queue maximum filling is volontarily raised so that you can see the changes easily
* plugin-related relative elapsed time, using progressreport
